# iOS_Research
Beginning stages of designing a facial recognition iOS game to analyze facial expressions and response times of children with autism.
Currently developing a simple game that moves onto next level/scene if correct button corresponding to facial expression is pressed. While this occurs, the webcam displays the player's face.
There is an option to Exit and Restart the game at anytime.
After an the correct answer is given, how long it took to press the correct answer is shown.
Eventually, one will have to imitate the facial feature in or order to move onto the next level/scene.
