Beginning stages of designing a facial recognition iOS game to analyze facial expressions and response times in children with autism.
Currently developing a simple game that moves onto next level/scene if correct button corresponding to facial expression is pressed. While this occurs, the webcam displays your face.
Eventually, one will have to imitate the facial feature in or order to move onto the next level/scene.
